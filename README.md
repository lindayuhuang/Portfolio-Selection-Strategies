# Portfolio-Selection-Strategies
This is one of the UofT MIE 1622 Computational Finance and Risk Management projects 

**Summary:**

The purpose of this assignment is to compare computational investment strategies based on selecting portfolio with minimizing portfolio variance, maximizing Sharpe ratio, equal risk contributions and using robust mean-variance optimization. The optimization process also needs to take into account th effect of trading costs.v

**Sub-tasks:** 
- Design and implement a rounding procedure, so always trade an integer number of shares; 
- Design and implement a validation procedure to test that each strategy is feasible (enough budget to re-balance, correctly compute transaction costs, funds in th cash account are non-negative);
- Test trading strategies for years 2019 and 2020 and years 2008 and 2009, and discuss and compare relative performance.
